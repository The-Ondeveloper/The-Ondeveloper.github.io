## Finger Pistols

- Solo project made for university. It's a vertical slice of a speedrunning precision platformer where you shoot obstcles in your environment
  with 'finger pistols' to trigger their affects as if you were physically touching them.

## Decent Dungeon 

- Group project also made for university, I was apart of a group called 'The OK 4'. It's a demo of an RPG dungeon crawler in the same vein as Elder Scrolls, I was the developer for the UI and player character.
