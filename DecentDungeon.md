## About

Decent Dungeon was a group project made for university, it was a somewhat over-ambitious dungeon crawler -considering the time frame and
team size we had to make it- inspired by the likes of The Elder Scrolls. We came up with the concept through our groups shared fondness
of RPGs, dungeon crawlers, and games like Elder Scrolls.

My role in the group was programming for the UI and character. For the project I developed a fairly simple character with Health and Stamina,
the character contains the inventory component and has the ability to hold equippable items. I also developed the inventory component and the mechanic for creating
inventory items. While I designed and programmed the layout of the UI, I did not make the assets for it nor did I create the 3D model for the sword.
